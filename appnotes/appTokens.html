        <p class=subhead>Application Tokens</p>
        <p class=normal>
            When you read this, application tokens may already be required for
            all Quickbase applications. Application tokens are a security feature.
            They are like an extra password that pieces of software that want to
            interact with Quickbase applications must present to the Quickbase application
            before the application will grant them access through the Quickbase HTTP API.
            Since QuNect ODBC for QuickBase communicates with Quickbase applications through
            the Quickbase HTTP API it must present an application token. Obviously
            not just any application token will work because there wouldn't be much security in that.
            So the question is how does an application decide whether a particular
            application token is legitimate. Well that's easy. For a brand new Quickbase application
            no application tokens qualify. This means that no software can communicate with
            that application yet, including QuNect ODBC for QuickBase. To remedy this situation you'll
            need to install an application token in your application. Go to your application's 
            home page and click on the <strong>Settings</strong> menu. Then select
            <strong>Application</strong>. Then click on <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>.
            To the right you'll see <strong>Application Tokens</strong>. Click on 
            <strong>Manage Application Tokens</strong>. You see a button at the top center of the
            page labeled <strong>Assign Application Token</strong>. Click on this button and you'll
            have two options: <strong>Assign Existing Token</strong> or <strong>Create New Token</strong>.
            Since this is our first application token we need to click on <strong>Create new Token</strong>.
            You'll be prompted for a description. You could type in <strong>QuNect</strong> here. Click OK
            and you've created your first application token. You'll see it listed in the table below the
            button. Now you'll need to copy the application token itself which is the nonsense string of characters
            in the first column of the table to the clipboard.
        </p>

            After installing QuNect ODBC for QuickBase you should enter your
            Quickbase username, password and application token for the two Data Sources that were created
            by the installation process. Click on the <strong>Start Menu</strong>
            and click on the <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Then click on
            <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>. Then click on
            <strong>Data Sources (ODBC)</strong>. Alternatively you can click on the
            <strong>Start Menu</strong>, then click on <strong>Run...</strong>, then type
            in <strong>odbcad32</strong> and finally click <strong>OK</strong>.
        </p>
         <p class=normal>
            Either way you'll end up at the dialog below:

            Double click on <strong>QuickBase via QuNect</strong>. You'll see the following
            dialog pop up.
        </p>
        <img src="i/configure.gif">
        <p class=normal>
            Enter your Quickbase username and password or <a href="/flash/UserToken.html">usertoken</a>.
		</p>
        <p class=normal>
			Make sure to enter a value for the <a href="/flash/QuickBaseServer.html">QuickBase Server</a> property.            
        </p>
        <p class=normal>
            You can use a preexisting application token by reading the instructions on
            <a href="https://help.quickbase.com/user-assistance/app_tokens.html#assign">how to use an existing application
            token</a>. If you use a usertoken instead of a password you don't need to supply an application token.
            Please read the section entitled <strong>Create and assign an application token</strong>
            on the Quickbase help page entitled <a href="https://help.quickbase.com/user-assistance/app_tokens.html">Application Tokens</a>.
            Click <strong>OK</strong> to
            save this information.
            Your <strong>User DSN</strong> is now configured.            
        </p>
         <p class=normal>
            Now let's move on to your <strong>System DSN</strong>.
            Back in the
            <strong>ODBC Data Source Administrator</strong> dialog, click on the
            <strong>System DSN</strong> tab. Then double click on <strong>QuickBase via QuNect</strong>.
            Enter the same information as above. Click <strong>OK</strong> to
            save this information. Congratulations! Your <strong>QuickBase via QuNect</strong> DSNs are fully configured.
