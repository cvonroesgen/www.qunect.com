        If you are running Windows Server 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016 etc. then you're running a server operating system and 
        you need to purchase <strong>QuNect ODBC for QuickBase 2016 (32 and 64 bit server)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class=question>How do I get updated versions of QuNect ODBC for QuickBase</p>

        <p class=subhead>Versions</p>
        <p class=question>How do I tell what version of QuNect ODBC for QuickBase I have installed?</p>
        <p class=answer>Start->All Programs->QuNect ODBC for QuickBase->32 Bit ODBC Admin->Drivers (tab)->Version (column) 
        If you're on a 64 bit machine then you'll need to also do  
        Start->All Programs->QuNect ODBC for QuickBase->64 Bit ODBC Admin->Drivers (tab)->Version (column)</p>
        <p class=question>How do I interpret the version number of QuNect ODBC for QuickBase?</p>
        <p class=answer>QuNect ODBC for QuickBase version numbers start with either a three or a six for 32 bit or 64 bit respectively.
        After the first period, the two digit year follows. 
        The remaining numbers just document the particular <a href="https://qunect.quickbase.com/db/bc9dktvup?a=q&qid=1">point release</a>.
        So the scheme is like this:</p>
        <p class=answer>for 32 bit</p>
        <p class=answer>3.YY.NN.NN</p>
        <p class=answer>for 64 bit</p>
        <p class=answer>6.YY.NN.NN</p>
        <p class=answer>Where YY is the two digit year and the NN.NN is the <a href="https://qunect.quickbase.com/db/bc9dktvup?a=q&qid=1">point release</a>.

        <p class=answer><a href="/appnotes/sqlSyntax.html">minimum+ SQL grammar</a></p>
        <p class=question>How do I specify dates?</p>
        <p class=answer>SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE datefield = {d '2008-04-25'}</p>

        <p class=answer>SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE timefield = {t '10:19:48'}</p>
        <p class=subhead>Quickbase Fields</p>
        <p class=question>Why do Quickbase user fields enclose names in double quotes?</p>
        <p class=answer>Please read <a href="/appnotes/userFields.html">Quickbase User Field Behaviour</a></p>
		<p class=question>How do I control the truncation of Quickbase text fields?</p>
        <p class=answer>Text fields are truncated by QuNect ODBC for QuickBase.
		If it's a single line text field (Quickbase field property <strong>Number of lines</strong> is set to one) then it's truncated to 255 characters.
		If it's a multi-line text field then (Quickbase field property <strong>Number of lines</strong> is greater than one) it's truncated to 65535 characters.
		But if you've set the <strong>Max characters</strong> property of the Quickbase field then it will be truncated to that length or to 65535 characters, whichever is the smaller number.</p>
        <p class=question>Why can't I use FIDs to refer to field names within SQL Server when I use the four part name syntax. When I use OPENQUERY in SQL Server I can refer to a field by it's name or by its field identifier?</p>
        <p class=answer>
        That's as designed. If you want to use FIDs with four part names you'll need to use a DSN with the checkbox checked that's labeled "Use field identifiers as field labels".
		But then you can't use the field names with four part names. This is a SQL Server limitation. When you talk to QuNect ODBC for QuickBase directly, as with OPENQUERY, it knows to consider both possibilities for field names.
		However SQL Server asks QuNect ODBC for a list of field names for each table in a SQL statement before it sends the SQL to QuNect ODBC for QuickBase. Then it verifies that each field in the SQL is valid.
		Since QuNect ODBC for QuickBase can present only one field name to SQL Server when it asks there is no possibility for matching either on field name or field identifier. It's one or the other.</p>
