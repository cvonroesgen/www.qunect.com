        <p class=subhead>Archiving Records from one Quickbase Application to a copy of the Application</p>
        <p class=normal>The following method will allow you to create space in your Quickbase application
            while preserving your archived records in an identical Quickbase application.</p>
<p class=normal>
<ol>
<li>Create a checkbox field at the top level of your parent child relationships. Whether it's a regular checkbox field or a formula checkbox field is up to you.</li>
<li>Create lookup fields for the checkbox field you created in step 1 at every level of the parent child hierarchy.</li> 
<li>Make a copy of your application without data.</li>
<li>Identify every table you want to archive. This may be all of the tables.</li>
<li>For each of the tables in the copy that will be archived that is the parent table in a relationship and whose key field is the built-in field called Record ID# you'll need to copy the Record ID# field.

Then make this field the key field. This will create a new reference field in each of the child tables and turn the old reference field into a lookup field.</li>
<li>Write a series of SQL INSERT statements that copies the records that you want to archive based on the checkbox fields you created in step 1 and 2 to their respective tables.
In each case where there is a table that is a parent table in a relationship and whose key field is the built-in field called Record ID#,
you'll want to copy the Record ID# field to the copy of the Record ID# field you created in the step 5. In each case where there is 
a table that is a child table in such a relationship, you'll want to copy the reference field to the new reference field you created in the step 5 when you changed the key field in the parent table.
</li>
<li>Write a series of SQL DELETE statements do delete the records that were archived based on the value of the checkbox fields created in step 1 and 2. The order of these SQL delete statements must proceed from the lowest level child table of the parent child hierarchy to the highest level parent.</li>
<li>Configure your DSN to represent file attachment fields as a <strong>Text field with File URL to file downloaded to local disk.</strong>. This will copy the current revision of your file attachments as well as all your other data.</li>
</ol>
