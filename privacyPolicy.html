                At QuNect, we are committed to protecting your privacy. 
                We use the information we collect about you to process orders only.
                We never sell information to a third party.
                What information do we collect? How do we use it?
                When you order with a credit card, we need to know your card holder name, credit card billing address, Quickbase username, credit card number, CVV code and expiration date.
                When you order with a purchase order, we need to know your purchase order number, accounts payable address, and Quickbase username.
                This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status.
                We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to Intuit Quickbase that impacts connectivity via QuNect ODBC for QuickBase.
                How does QuNect protect customer information?
                We protect your transaction with a secure server using industry standard 128 bit SSL encryption.
                This ensures that your credit card number is encrypted and can not be read by unauthorized persons as they are transmitted over the Internet.
                What about "cookies"?
                "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.
