        <p class=subhead>Synching a SQL Server table in Quickbase</p>
        <p class=normal>The following stored procedure will synch a table from SQL Server to Quickbase.
        After running this stored procedure the table in Quickbase will be up to date with the table in SQL Server.
        Records that have been deleted on SQL Server will only
	be deleted in Quickbase if the @deleteOrphanRecords is equal to 1. If you set the @deleteOrphanRecords equal to 1
        then there must be a checkbox field in the Quickbase table called <strong>Orphan</strong>. This checkbox field is
        used to efficently determine which Quickbase records need to be deleted.
        This stored procedure only modifies the Quickbase table, not the corresponding SQL Server table.
        It has a required parameter: <strong>SQLTableName</strong>. The <strong>SQLTableName</strong>
        should be the name of the table in SQL Server that you want to synch over to Quickbase. Another required parameter
        is the <strong>dbid</strong> of the Quickbase table to synch information to. In addition
        you'll need to set the required parameter <strong>QDBAppName</strong> to the name of the Quickbase application.
        You can find the DBID of a Quickbase table by reading the
        <a href="dbid.html">How to Find the DBID of a Quickbase Table</a> application note.
        You'll also need to identify a field in the SQL Server table that changes whenever a
        modification is made to any other field in the same SQL Server record. This field must be a datetime 
        field. A typical name for this kind of field is <strong>Date Modified</strong>.
        This SQL Server field's name should become the value of the required parameter
        called <strong>SQLDateModifiedFieldName</strong>. Next you'll need to identify a field in the
        corresponding Quickbase table that is also a <strong>Date / Time</strong> field. 
        The name of this field should become 
        the value of the required parameter <strong>QuickBaseDateModifiedFieldName</strong>. 
        Every Quickbase table comes with five
        built-in fields. One of these is a <strong>Date / Time</strong> called <strong>Date Modified</strong>.
        This is a read-only field and only Quickbase modifies the value of this field when other field values change.
        The parameter <strong>QuickBaseDateModifiedFieldName</strong> should never be set to the name of this field.
        You must use another user created <strong>Date / Time</strong> field.
        Another pair of field names need to be specified.
        The key field in SQL Server <strong>SQLKey</strong> and the copy of this key field in
        Quickbase <strong>QDBKey</strong>. They need to be of the same type of course.
        Also the key field of the Quickbase table should be set to
        <strong>QDBKey</strong>. 
        Then you'll need to specify two comma delimited lists of fields names.
        <strong>QuickBaseFieldList</strong> and <strong>SQLFieldList</strong>. These two field lists need to
        have the same number of fields in them and they have to have matching field types. They should not contain
        the fields defined previously as <strong>SQLKey</strong> and <strong>QDBKey</strong>.
        Field names within these comma separated lists will have to be double quote enclosed.

-- Author:		Claude von Roesgen Copyright 2008
-- Create date: 01/11/2008
-- Description:	Synchronize a table from SQL Server to Quickbase.
--				This stored procedure depends on the existance of a linked server called
--				Quickbase. To create this linked server run the following SQL:
--
--					EXEC sp_addlinkedserver 
--					@server = 'QuickBase', 
--					@provider = 'MSDASQL',
--					@srvproduct = 'QuNect',
--					@provstr = 'DSN=QuickBase via QuNect;UID=claude;PWD=YourPassword' 
--					GO
--
--              After you have your linked server in place you're ready to run the stored 
--				procedure below. Both the SQL Server table and the Quickbase table must preexist.
--				Only the records that have been modified since the last
--				sync will be imported. Records that have been deleted on SQL Server will only
--				be deleted in Quickbase if the @deleteOrphanRecords is equal to 1.
--				You must double quote enclose field names within the @SQLFieldList and @QuickBaseFieldList parameters.
--				For example you must refer to Date Created as "Date Created". 
--				Since field names are easily changed in Quickbase you may want to refer to the fields 
--				by their field identifiers instead of their field labels. The field identifiers never
--				change, even when the field name is changed.
