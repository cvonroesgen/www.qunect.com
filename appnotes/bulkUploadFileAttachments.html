        <p class=subhead>Bulk Uploading File Attachments to Quickbase</p>
        
        <p class=normal>To bulk upload files to a file attachment field in Quickbase you want to make sure that 
        you have your DSN configured with <strong>File Attachment Fields -> Represent as:</strong> set to <strong>Text field with URL to file attachment in Quickbase</strong>
        If you are using a connection string instead of a DSN make sure you are NOT using the <strong>FILE=BINARY</strong> or the <strong>FILEPATH=C:\Folder1\Folder2</strong> 
        <a href="connectionString.html">connection string</a> parameters.
        The file attachment field in Quickbase is presented via QuNect ODBC for QuickBase as a text field. The text field contains the URL
        to the file attachment itself. If you set this text value using either an INSERT or an UPDATE statement to the fully qualified path of a file 
        on the computer where QuNect ODBC for QuickBase is installed, QuNect ODBC for QuickBase will upload that file into the file attachment field.
        For example the following SQL statement will create a new record placing the file <strong>C:\autoexec.bat</strong> into the file attachment
        field called <strong>Batch Files</strong></p>
<p class=code>
<pre>
INSERT INTO "File Table bepza6nb3" ("Batch Files") Values ('C:\autoexec.bat')
</pre>
</p>
<p class=normal>
    You could upload the C:\autoexec.bat file to all records that did not already 
    have an attached file in the <strong>Batch Files</strong> field like this:
</p>
<p class=code>
<pre>
UPDATE "File Table bepza6nb3" SET "Batch Files"='C:\autoexec.bat' WHERE "Batch Files"=''
</pre>
</p>
<p class=normal>    
    Both of these examples are not that useful. But they serve to illustrate the basic capablity.
    To do a bulk upload you need to have preexisting records to upload the files into. The records
    need to have enough information in them to let you know which file belongs in which record. So in the simplest case
    if there was a text field called <strong>File Name</strong> that contained the name of the file
    that needed to be uploaded to the <strong>Picture</strong> field, then you could write a SQL statement like this to upload a folder 
    full of pictures. Let's assume the folder full of pictures is <strong>D:\Employees\Pictures\</strong>
</p>
<p class=code>
<pre>
UPDATE "Employees beqra6nb3" SET "Picture"={fn CONCAT('D:\Employees\Pictures\', "File Name")} WHERE "Picture"='' and "File Name" <> ''
</pre>
</p>
<p class=normal>    
    If the <strong>File Name</strong> contained only the prefix of the file name but not the file extension then you could
    append the file extension like this:
</p>
<p class=code>
<pre>
UPDATE "Employees beqra6nb3" SET "Picture"={fn CONCAT({fn CONCAT('D:\Employees\Pictures\', "File Name")}, '.jpg')} WHERE "Picture"='' and "File Name" <> ''
</pre>
</p>
<p class=normal>    
    If you don't have preexisting records then you can create them with the filename in a text field by running a directory listing of the folder
    that contains the files you want to upload. If you pipe this directory listing to a file you can import the directory listing file into the Quickbase table
    where you want to bulk upload the file attachments. Now you have preexisting records with the filenames in a regular text field. The DOS command
    to create a directory listing (of the directory <strong>C:\Employees\Pictures</strong>) in a file (called <strong>filewithfilenames.csv</strong>) looks like this:
</p>
<p class=code>
<pre>
C:\Employees\Pictures>dir /b > filewithfilenames.csv
</pre>
</p>
</body>
</body>
